## FastAPI Server for Image Embeddings (3/13/2025, 10:16:46 PM)

_**User**_

i want to build a fastAPI server to create embeddings of the images in the /images folder using openAI CLIP. This should be POST request at the /upsert URL that expects images. I also want to create a /search endpoint, where we expect a text querty that we will create embeddings for using CLIP, and then use qdrant to perform similiarity search, returning the most similiar matches from the data set. let's make sure that when we upsert our images into QDRANT, we also upsert the filename so that the frontend will be able to display them properly 

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you build a FastAPI server with CLIP embeddings and Qdrant for similarity search. Let's break this down into steps:

1. First, let's check if we have a project structure and create necessary files.

</details>

_****_

Great! I see we have an `images` directory. Let's create a FastAPI server with the necessary dependencies and endpoints. I'll create a `main.py` file with our server implementation.

I've created a complete FastAPI server implementation with the following features:

1. Two main endpoints:
   - `/upsert`: Accepts image files, generates CLIP embeddings, and stores them in Qdrant
   - `/search`: Accepts text queries, generates CLIP embeddings, and returns similar images

2. Key components:
   - CLIP model for generating embeddings from both images and text
   - Qdrant vector database for storing and searching embeddings
   - FastAPI for the web server
   - CORS middleware enabled for frontend integration

3. The system stores both embeddings and filenames in Qdrant, making it easy to display images on the frontend.

To get started:

1. First, make sure you have Qdrant running. You can start it with Docker:
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the server:
```bash
python main.py
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8000`. You can use the `/upsert` endpoint to upload images and `/search` endpoint to find similar images using text queries.

Would you like me to help you test the endpoints or make any modifications to the implementation?

_**User**_

i want to use qdrant cloud

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the code to use Qdrant Cloud instead of a local Qdrant instance. First, we'll need to get your Qdrant Cloud credentials and update the client configuration.

Let's create a `.env` file to store your Qdrant Cloud credentials securely:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ QDRANT_URL=your-cluster-url.qdrant.tech
+ QDRANT_API_KEY=your-api-key 
```

---

_****_

Now, let's modify the `main.py` file to use Qdrant Cloud instead of the local instance:

---

_****_

```diff
  from qdrant_client.http import models
  import numpy as np
+ from dotenv import load_dotenv
+ 
+ # Load environment variables
+ load_dotenv()
  
  app = FastAPI()
  processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
  
- # Initialize Qdrant client
- qdrant_client = QdrantClient("localhost", port=6333)
+ # Initialize Qdrant client with cloud credentials
+ qdrant_client = QdrantClient(
+     url=os.getenv("QDRANT_URL"),
+     api_key=os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY"),
+ )
  COLLECTION_NAME = "image_collection"
  
```

---

_****_

Let's also update the README.md to reflect these changes:

---

_****_

```diff
- # Image Search API with CLIP and Qdrant
+ # Image Search API with CLIP and Qdrant Cloud

+ This FastAPI server provides endpoints for uploading images and performing semantic similarity search using OpenAI's CLIP model and Qdrant Cloud vector database.
  
  ## Prerequisites
  
  - Python 3.8+
- - Qdrant running locally (or accessible via network)
+ - Qdrant Cloud account (sign up at https://cloud.qdrant.io/)
  
  ## Setup
  ```
  
- 2. Make sure Qdrant is running. You can run it using Docker:
- 
- ```bash
- docker run -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
+ 2. Set up your Qdrant Cloud credentials:
+    - Create an account at https://cloud.qdrant.io/
+    - Create a new cluster
+    - Copy your cluster URL and API key
+    - Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
+    ```
+    QDRANT_URL=your-cluster-url.qdrant.tech
+    QDRANT_API_KEY=your-api-key
     ```
  
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "a red car"}' http://localhost:8000/search
  ```
+ 
+ ## Security Note
+ Make sure to keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.
  
```

---

_****_

Let's also create a `.gitignore` file to ensure the `.env` file isn't accidentally committed:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ .env
+ __pycache__/
+ *.pyc
+ .DS_Store 
```

---

_****_

To use Qdrant Cloud with your application, you'll need to:

1. Sign up for a Qdrant Cloud account at https://cloud.qdrant.io/
2. Create a new cluster
3. Get your cluster URL and API key
4. Update the `.env` file with your actual credentials:
   - Replace `your-cluster-url.qdrant.tech` with your actual cluster URL
   - Replace `your-api-key` with your actual API key

The main changes I've made to switch to Qdrant Cloud are:
1. Added environment variable support using python-dotenv
2. Updated the Qdrant client initialization to use cloud credentials
3. Added proper documentation and security measures
4. Removed local Qdrant setup instructions

The functionality remains the same, but now your vector database is hosted in the cloud instead of running locally. This provides several benefits:
- No need to manage your own Qdrant instance
- Automatic backups and maintenance
- Better scalability
- High availability

Would you like me to help you set up your Qdrant Cloud account or make any additional modifications to the code?

if the collection doesn't exist, when we start up the server, let's upsert our images into the qdrant collection after creating it

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the code to automatically upsert images from the `/images` directory when creating a new collection. First, let's add a function to handle this initial upload:

```

_****_

I've made several improvements to the code:

1. Added a new `process_image_file` function that handles processing individual image files and generating their embeddings.

2. Added an `initial_image_upload` function that:
   - Looks for images in the `/images` directory
   - Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, and `.png` files
   - Processes images in batches of 100 to avoid memory issues
   - Prints progress information during upload

3. Modified the collection creation logic to:
   - Print status messages about collection existence/creation
   - Automatically trigger the initial image upload when creating a new collection

4. Improved the `/upsert` endpoint to:
   - Use sequential IDs based on the current collection size
   - Avoid ID conflicts with existing points

Let's also update the README to reflect these changes:

---

_****_

```diff
     ```
  
- 3. Start the server:
+ 3. Prepare your images:
+    - Create an `images` directory in the project root
+    - Place your image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.png`) in this directory
+    - These images will be automatically uploaded to Qdrant when starting the server for the first time
+ 
+ 4. Start the server:
  
  ```bash
  
  The server will run at `http://localhost:8000`
+ 
+ When starting the server for the first time:
+ - A new collection will be created in Qdrant Cloud
+ - All images from the `images` directory will be automatically processed and uploaded
+ - Progress information will be printed to the console
  
  ## API Endpoints
  ## Example Usage
  
- ### Upload Images
+ ### Upload Additional Images
  
  ```bash
```

---

_****_

Now when you start the server:
1. If the collection doesn't exist, it will be created
2. All images in the `/images` directory will be automatically processed and uploaded to Qdrant
3. The upload process happens in batches to handle large numbers of images efficiently
4. You'll see progress information in the console

The `/upsert` endpoint remains available for uploading additional images after the server is running.

Would you like me to help you test the automatic upload functionality or make any adjustments to the implementation?

Error processing images/462_bathroom.jpg: Unable to create tensor, you should probably activate padding with 'padding=True' to have batched tensors with the same length.

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. We need to handle image preprocessing properly with CLIP, including resizing and padding. Let's modify the `process_image_file` function to properly preprocess the images before generating embeddings:

---

_****_

```diff
      try:
          with Image.open(image_path) as image:
+             # Convert to RGB if needed (handles RGBA, grayscale, etc.)
+             if image.mode != "RGB":
+                 image = image.convert("RGB")
+             
              # Generate embedding
              embedding = get_image_embedding(image)
  def get_image_embedding(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for an image."""
-     inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
+     # Preprocess image for CLIP
+     inputs = processor(
+         images=image,
+         return_tensors="pt",
+         padding=True,
+         truncation=True
+     )
+     
+     with torch.no_grad():
          image_features = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
      return image_features.detach().numpy()[0]
  
  def get_text_embedding(text: str) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for text."""
-     inputs = processor(text=text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
+     inputs = processor(
+         text=text,
+         return_tensors="pt",
+         padding=True,
+         truncation=True
+     )
+     
+     with torch.no_grad():
          text_features = model.get_text_features(**inputs)
      return text_features.detach().numpy()[0]
```

---

_****_

I've made several improvements to handle image processing better:

1. Added RGB conversion for images that might be in other formats (RGBA, grayscale, etc.)
2. Added `truncation=True` to both image and text processing to handle longer sequences
3. Added `torch.no_grad()` context managers to reduce memory usage during inference
4. Properly structured the processor calls with all necessary parameters

These changes should fix the error you encountered. The improvements will:
- Handle images in different color formats
- Properly pad and truncate inputs as needed
- Be more memory efficient with torch operations

Let's also update the `/upsert` endpoint to use the same improved processing:

              embedding = get_image_embedding(image)
```

Now try running the server again. The image processing should work properly for all your images, including the problematic bathroom image. The improvements handle:
1. Different image color modes (RGB, RGBA, grayscale)
2. Proper padding and truncation for CLIP processing
3. More efficient memory usage during inference

Would you like me to help you test the changes or make any additional improvements?

_**Assistant**_

Let's modify the image preprocessing to ensure it matches CLIP's expected input format. The issue might be related to how CLIP processes images. We need to ensure the images are properly resized and transformed according to CLIP's requirements:

---

_****_

```diff
  def get_image_embedding(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for an image."""
-     # Preprocess image for CLIP
-     inputs = processor(
+     # Preprocess image for CLIP using the image processor component
+     inputs = processor.image_processor(
          images=image,
-         return_tensors="pt",
-         padding=True,
-         truncation=True
+         return_tensors="pt"
      )
      
  def get_text_embedding(text: str) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for text."""
-     inputs = processor(
-         text=text,
-         return_tensors="pt",
+     # Preprocess text using the tokenizer component
+     inputs = processor.tokenizer(
+         text,
          padding=True,
-         truncation=True
+         truncation=True,
+         return_tensors="pt"
      )
      
```

---

_****_

The key changes I've made:

1. For image processing:
   - Now using `processor.image_processor` directly instead of the combined processor
   - Removed unnecessary padding and truncation parameters which are only needed for text
   - The image processor will automatically handle resizing and normalization

2. For text processing:
   - Now using `processor.tokenizer` directly for text inputs
   - Kept padding and truncation which are needed for text processing

This change separates the image and text processing pipelines, using the appropriate component for each type of input. The CLIP image processor will automatically:
- Resize images to the correct dimensions
- Convert to RGB
- Normalize pixel values
- Handle the tensor conversion

Try running the server again. The error should be resolved now as we're using the proper image processing pipeline that's specifically designed for CLIP's image inputs.

Would you like me to help you test these changes or make any additional improvements?

what is the number of dimensions for CLIP embeddings

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, we can see that CLIP embeddings have 512 dimensions, as specified in the collection creation parameters:

```12:15:main.py
    qdrant_client.create_collection(
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
            size=512,  # CLIP embedding dimension
            distance=models.Distance.COSINE
        )
```

This is because we're using the "openai/clip-vit-base-patch32" model, which outputs 512-dimensional embeddings for both images and text. This is defined in the model architecture where:

1. The vision transformer (ViT) part processes images into 512-dimensional vectors
2. The text transformer processes text into matching 512-dimensional vectors

This allows for direct comparison between image and text embeddings using cosine similarity, which is why we specified `distance=models.Distance.COSINE` in the Qdrant collection configuration.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try using CLIP's processor in a different way. The issue might be with how we're handling the image processing. Let's modify the code to use the processor's `__call__` method with the correct parameters:

---

_****_

```diff
  def get_image_embedding(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for an image."""
-     # Preprocess image for CLIP using the image processor component
-     inputs = processor.image_processor(
+     # Preprocess image for CLIP
+     inputs = processor(
          images=image,
-         return_tensors="pt"
+         return_tensors="pt",
+         padding=True,
+         do_resize=True,
+         do_center_crop=True,
      )
      
  def get_text_embedding(text: str) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for text."""
-     # Preprocess text using the tokenizer component
-     inputs = processor.tokenizer(
-         text,
+     # Preprocess text
+     inputs = processor(
+         text=text,
+         return_tensors="pt",
          padding=True,
          truncation=True,
-         return_tensors="pt"
+         max_length=77  # CLIP's maximum context length
      )
      
```

---

_****_

The key changes I've made:

1. For image processing:
   - Switched back to using the main `processor` with explicit parameters
   - Added `do_resize=True` to ensure images are resized to CLIP's expected dimensions
   - Added `do_center_crop=True` to ensure consistent image dimensions
   - Added `padding=True` to handle any remaining dimension mismatches

2. For text processing:
   - Using the main `processor` with text-specific parameters
   - Added `max_length=77` which is CLIP's maximum context length
   - Kept padding and truncation for proper text handling

These changes should properly handle the image preprocessing by:
1. Resizing images to CLIP's expected input size
2. Center cropping to maintain aspect ratio
3. Ensuring proper padding
4. Using the processor's built-in image transformation pipeline

Try running the server again. The error should be resolved now as we're explicitly setting all the necessary preprocessing parameters for CLIP.

Would you like me to help you test these changes or make any additional improvements?

Error processing ./images/457_kitchen.jpg: Unable to create tensor, you should probably activate padding with 'padding=True' to have batched tensors with the same length.

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try a different approach by using CLIP's vision processor directly and ensuring the image is properly preprocessed to the exact size CLIP expects. The CLIP ViT model expects images to be resized to 224x224 pixels:

---

_****_

```diff
  def get_image_embedding(image: Image.Image) -> np.ndarray:
      """Generate CLIP embedding for an image."""
-     # Preprocess image for CLIP
-     inputs = processor(
-         images=image,
-         return_tensors="pt",
-         padding=True,
-         do_resize=True,
-         do_center_crop=True,
+     # Resize image to CLIP's expected size (224x224)
+     image = image.resize((224, 224), Image.Resampling.LANCZOS)
+     
+     # Convert to RGB numpy array
+     image_array = np.array(image)
+     
+     # Preprocess image for CLIP using vision processor
+     inputs = processor.vision_processor(
+         images=image_array,
+         return_tensors="pt"
      )
      
```

---

_****_

The key changes I've made:

1. Explicitly resize the image to 224x224 pixels (CLIP's expected input size) using high-quality LANCZOS resampling
2. Convert the PIL Image to a numpy array
3. Use CLIP's vision processor directly instead of the combined processor
4. Removed unnecessary parameters since we're handling the resizing ourselves

This approach should be more reliable because:
1. We're ensuring the exact image dimensions that CLIP expects
2. We're using a high-quality resampling method (LANCZOS)
3. We're bypassing any automatic resizing/cropping that might cause issues
4. We're using the vision processor directly which is specifically designed for image inputs

Try running the server again. The error should be resolved now as we're explicitly controlling the image preprocessing pipeline and ensuring consistent input dimensions.

Let's try using the CLIP processor in a simpler way and add more error handling to see what's going wrong. Let's modify the image processing function:

          with torch.no_grad():
              image_features = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
          return image_features.detach().numpy()[0]

+         raise
  
  def get_text_embedding(text: str) -> np.ndarray:
```

---

_****_

The key changes I've made:

1. Added better error handling to see exactly where things are failing
2. Removed manual resizing and let CLIP handle it
3. Added CLIP's specific mean and std values for proper normalization
4. Added a fallback method that tries processing with a list wrapper
5. Added more detailed error messages

The changes should:
1. Give us better insight into what's failing if the error persists
2. Use CLIP's default preprocessing pipeline which should handle all necessary transformations
3. Properly normalize the images using CLIP's specific normalization values
4. Have a fallback method in case the processor expects a different input format

Try running the server again. If the error persists, we should see more detailed error messages that will help us understand exactly what's going wrong. Could you share any new error messages you see?

_**Assistant**_

That warning is not actually related to our image processing error - it's just a warning from PyTorch about NumPy initialization. Let's try a different approach using CLIP's feature extractor directly:

---

_****_

```diff

-             # Fallback: try with a list
-             inputs = processor(

-                 image_mean=[0.48145466, 0.4578275, 0.40821073],

+         # Use feature extractor directly
+         inputs = feature_extractor(
+             images=image,
+             return_tensors="pt"
          )
          
```

---

_****_

The key changes I've made:

1. Added `CLIPFeatureExtractor` import which is specifically designed for processing images
2. Initialized the feature extractor separately from the processor
3. Simplified the image processing by using the feature extractor directly
4. Removed the numpy array conversion step since the feature extractor can handle PIL images directly

The feature extractor is specifically designed for processing images for CLIP and handles all the necessary steps:
- Resizing
- Normalization
- Tensor conversion
- Proper padding

This should resolve the error as we're now using the proper tool for image processing. Try running the server again. The warning about NumPy initialization can be safely ignored as it doesn't affect functionality.

Would you like me to help you test these changes or make any additional improvements?
